<h2>IDEAS: </h2>
<h3>LEVELS: </h3>
save state.</br>
3 players VS enemy waves.</br>
every player has weaknesses/strengths/elemental spells/physical skills/buffs.</br>
weapon types have strengths/weaknesses (?).</br>

<h3>ENEMIES: </h3>
make several enemy classes (auto-scale).</br>
boss every 5 waves (bosses autoscale).</br>
