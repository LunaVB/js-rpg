<h2>IDEAS: <h2>

### PLAYERS
LEVELS </br>
save state.</br>
3 players VS enemy waves.</br>
every player has weaknesses/strengths/elemental spells/physical skills/buffs.</br>
weapon types have strengths/weaknesses (?).</br>

### ENEMIES
make several enemy classes (auto-scale).</br>
boss every 5 waves (bosses autoscale).</br>

### Bugs:
characters can be deselected after game start (only visually).</br>
